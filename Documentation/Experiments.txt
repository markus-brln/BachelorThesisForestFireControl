Different levels of difficulty:

NOTE:
Comparing the amount of cells conserved may be useless because
all architectures will learn from the same data. We could only
employ additional algorithms to dig closer to the fire etc.
The main difference between the algorithms would be how well
they generalize for different environments, in my estimation.

1. BASIC [WORKS]
setting:
- 5 agents, static spawning in regular distance, 70 agent radius, 1/3 fire speed, no wind
tactic:
- all digging, close circle, then go outwards still digging
files:
- mEASYFIVE.npy

2. STOCHASTIC [WORKS mostly]
setting:
- same as 1., just agent spawn uncertainty = 10 cells
tactic:
- same as 1.
files:
- mEASYFIVESTOCHASTIC0.npy, mEASYFIVESTOCHASTIC1.npy, mEASYFIVESTOCHASTIC2.npy
