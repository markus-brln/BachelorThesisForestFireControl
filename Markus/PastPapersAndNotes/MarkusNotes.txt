notes for meeting:


- waypoints realistic, not always 100% up-to-date
- what different algorithms are there to get to the next waypoint?
  would they even make a difference (in our projects??) -> how far
  away would the waypoints have to be for that?
- necessary to go so in depth with CNNs in paper?

  
- contract?
- next time maybe come up with an env (not too complex, then extend if 
  supervisors want to)
