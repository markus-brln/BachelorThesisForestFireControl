research question:
	- Can learning from demonstration
          with a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)
          effectively be used to isolate forest fires in simulation?
          
- Human interactive DCNN (HI-DCNN) approach
- episode: start -> death of agent / containment of fire
- Environment:
	• An agent (bulldozer/woodcutter)
	• Forest
	• A house
	• Water
	• Dirt (a place where the bulldozer has been digging)
	• Fire (burning forest)
	• Fire (burning house)
	• Burned forest
	• Burned house

- 10x10, 20x20, 40x40
- CNN (like picture)
- 4 types of complexity in env compared
- 6 binary maps shown to CNN
- model, architecture, layers, optimizer, validation, early stopping blablabla
- 12 envs, played 50 training, 20 validation episodes
- extra double data 50, 20 for comparison
- HI-DCNN -> CNN tries, if fail, human tries to solve it -> that's where the extra
  data comes from
- 30 models tested on 100 random episodes

Conclusions:
- more data, better ofc, already works 93% of the time for simple env
- human help with failed episodes significantly better than just more training data
- cry for more agents
